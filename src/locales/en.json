      "li1":"vuejs has less volume than rect and engiolar frameworks, which of course affects the overall volume and speed of your application.",
      "li2":"it's very good for freelancers because according to the relatively easy syntax, it speeds up your coding and you don't need your code.",
      "li3":"sites that are coded with vue code have better seo than other sites and this is a very, very good feature .",
      "li4":"vue doesn't need that much analysis because of its simple syntax, and that's why it's possible to telecommute in iran.",
      "li5":"if you dominate vue , you can also work with alpine gs . because they have the same syntax .",
      "li6":"you can run spe sites with them. (i'll tell them ( e jax on his head)",
      "li7":"you can responsive your pages using vuetify.",

    "h2":"my passion.",
    "p2":"my passion for childhood goes back to my kid's computer, and i said to myself, there's no way i can hate what's in the field of computers. like most programmer kids now, i've been spending a lot of time with our home computers, and thank god his system was so weak that it couldn't be played on it, and that's why i think kelly put me ahead because if i went back in the game phase, in short, i'd go through it all with our blood computer until i helped to search and research google. when i was very much in the start-up phase and i was all searching google how to make money from the internet and my work had reached the site of click and pyramid that was not time for a fusion, a little bit i went into the design phase of logos and posters and these stories at the time i was guided i think i was 10 11 years old and i was not yet familiar with coding and the world of programming.",
    "h3":"my dark times.",
    "p3":"well, it passed, and i was doing content production, and adub premiere had just learned to think it was at the bottom of the computer, and i was very badass at the end of our conservatory, and iðŸ˜‚ was a little into the mood of depression because i was getting very annoyed by school and family, and i was briefly in the black phase, and at that time i was actually familiar with the concept of hacker and hacking, and i wanted to be an anti-government black hat hacker. the conservatory was always one of the last in terms of lessons and grades, a reclusive kid who doesn't like anyone, has no interest in math and study, and wants to beat each other up.",
    "h4":"i'm just getting well.",
    "p4":"those three years were one of the hardest years of my life, thank god it ended, and i went to my interests, and i can really say that my life has changed. i went to the conservatory of web design knowledge at the time everyone thought the conservatory was bad all cigarettes and miserable and not studying and staying with the family on this issue i discussed your head and i went to register with my head and the first year of the first semester i stamped the first person of the classroomsðŸ™ƒ surely you think the school level was low? or were the others not studying? no, i was just going after my interests, i was still in the hacker phase at the time, and i had gone through a few periods, but i realized i couldn't go any further because i don't know any programming at all, i don't know any language to hack with, and i realized that i couldn't make a proper roadmap.",
    "h5":"the second phase of my life :)",
    "p5":"I was 14 years old, so I thought it was very hard for me to put the hack and security aside, but I had to because I had a goal. Because my field of study was web design (I went to school a year earlier) I decided to start web design and go to JavaScript, but it was too big for me, so I started with the sultan of WordPress xD. Next year means the eleventh year of my internship that all my ages were having a passion and being playing I got my first official specialized job, yes wordpress site designer I worked in a company with a monthly salary of 1200 I had to say at the time I felt so bad ðŸ˜‚ I wanted to work more in the company but only three months in the summer and I was able to stay and then start schools... Then I worked on it whole, either as a freelancer or a project. When I felt like I was full on WordPress, I went to JavaScript and the popular framework of Hearts vue :)",
    "h6":"personal site story",
    "p6":"i always wanted to have a personal site, i had already been with wordpress, but i never sat down because i liked to code and implement the template from zero, first i wanted to do it with bootstrap, but i still sat down, so i decided to learn vue with vuetify, which is like bootstrap, with some differences and this case took me a lot of time to say i had 4 months. i was training, not on a continuous basis. in short, you can see that the back is a lot of effort.",
    "h7":"forward to the future",
    "p7":"like i said, everyone has a roadmap for themselves, and i was supposed to finish front first and go to beck's side, then full-time hacks and security, but now that i'm seeing, i can't stop trying to start beck's side, then hacking and security, then the design of this site that you're reading now is over and i went into the big, hard-headed area of hacking and security. my branch is web penetration test and i have installments besides to learn golang goo language to write my tools with it. i'm sorry i hurt your head, i hope you liked the story of myðŸ™‚ life, you'd like me to follow me on social media to learn more about it."
